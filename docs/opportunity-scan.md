# Lab 02 Opportunity Scanning

## Ideas Reviewed from Lab 1

| Idea | Problem Area | Target User | Current Alternative | Initial Technology Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Idea 1: Smart Campus Lost-and-Found System** | Students lose items on campus and do not know where to report or search for them. | University students, security staff, and administrative staff. | Posting in chat groups or asking security manually. | HTML/CSS/JS frontend, database or Google Sheets backend, image upload, and search/filter functions. |
| **Idea 2: Digital Notice Board** | Scattered event information across the university. | University students. | Line Chats in the university. | Web or mobile app with a simple catalog display and an SMS alerting API. |
| **Idea 3: Student Skill-Share & Project Matchmaker** | Students struggle to find peers outside their friend circles with complementary skills for startup teams or assignments. | University students looking for project collaborators. | Random assignments by professors or posting on massive, unstructured social media forums. | Web dashboard with data search filtering components and a simple match notification system. |
| **Idea 4: Campus Navigation** | New and current students or visitors struggle to navigate the large Rangsit University campus efficiently. | Rangsit University students, staff, lecturers, visitors, and parents. | Static campus maps or asking for directions from others. | Web application (HTML/CSS/JS or React), Google Maps API (or custom map system), and a Firebase/MySQL backend. |

## Opportunity Discovery Table

| No. | Observed Problem | Target User | Current Alternative | Possible IT Solution | Feasible Technology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Items lost on campus take days to find due to lack of a centralized reporting system. | Students, security guards, admin staff. | Posting pictures in unorganized chat groups or physical lost boxes. | A web-based submission form with an item status dashboard (Lost / Found / Claimed). | Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS or Flutter Web.<br>Backend: Firebase Storage (for images) & Firestore. |
| **2** | Students miss deadlines or campus events because announcements are scattered across different group chats. | Active students, club organizers, university faculty. | Scrolling through noisy Line group chats or looking at physical posters. | A unified digital billboard app where organizers post events and students can filter by category or register. | Web/Mobile Application, Node.js backend, or integration with a third-party SMS/Notification API. |
| **3** | Finding teammates with specific technical or design skills outside of existing friend groups is difficult. | Group project leaders, startup-minded students. | Random assignment by professors or unorganized posts on broad social media groups. | A skills matchmaking profile catalog with advanced query filtering based on tags. | React or Flutter frontend, relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) or simple mock JSON filtering. |
| **4** | New students and visitors get lost looking for specific classrooms, labs, or available parking zones on a large campus. | RSU freshmen, visitors, guest lecturers. | Relying on static image maps or stopping strangers to ask for directions. | An interactive map web dashboard with searchable room numbers, building indexes, and parking filters. | Leaflet.js, Google Maps API, Flutter with Map coordinates, and Firebase for saving location data points. |
| **5** | Academic burnout and missed submissions due to uncoordinated due dates across different modules. | Overwhelmed students and academic advisors. | Relying on manual calendar entries or memory. | A centralized kanban or calendar dashboard that dynamically maps upcoming university deadlines with priority tagging. | HTML5 Calendar APIs, React.js or Flutter, and LocalStorage or Firestore database structures. |
| **6** | Campus infrastructure defects remain broken for long periods because reporting processes are slow or non-transparent. | Students, faculty, campus maintenance teams. | Verbosely explaining issues to front-desk staff or leaving them unresolved. | An anonymous reporting portal where students drop pinned pins of broken equipment and track resolution pipelines. | Geolocation services, image uploads via HTML form inputs, and status pipelines handled via a Firestore database. |

## Technology Feasibility Mapping

| Idea | Prototype Type | Tools Needed | Data Needed | Difficulty | Feasible? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Idea 1: Lost & Found** | Functional Web Prototype | HTML/JS or Flutter Web, Firebase Auth, Firestore. | Mock list of items (description, category, date, image URL, contact info). | **Medium** | **Yes** |
| **Idea 2: Digital Board** | Frontend-focused Dashboard | Web app or Flutter, basic database, notification services. | Event details (title, organizer, date, venue, registration links). | **Medium** | **Yes** |
| **Idea 3: Matchmaker** | Data-driven Web UI | React/Vue or Flutter, MySQL/Firebase, Skill tag libraries. | Student profiles (name, skills, interests) and project listings (roles needed). | **Medium** | **Yes** |
| **Idea 4: Campus Nav** | Interactive Map App | Web App, Google Maps API / Leaflet.js, Firebase. | Geolocation coordinates of RSU buildings, room indexes, and building photos. | **High** | **Yes** |
| **Idea 5: Deadline Board** | Direct Calendar Widget | Vue/React or Flutter Frontend, Moment.js or date-fns utils. | Course codes, assignments titles, cutoff times, and color-coded tags. | **Low** | **Yes** |
| **Idea 6: Complaint Web** | CRUD Ticketing App | HTML/CSS/JS or Bootstrap, Node.js/Express, or Firebase. | Facility locations, category catalogs (IT, Utilities, Furniture), tracking tickets. | **Medium** | **Yes** |
